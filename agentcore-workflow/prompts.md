# AgentCore Workshop: Build a Returns & Refunds Agent with Vibe Coding

Welcome! In this workshop, you'll build a production-ready returns and refunds assistant using Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. 

**The best part?** You'll build everything through vibe coding with Kiro - no manual coding required! Just describe what you want in natural language, and Kiro generates all the code for you. Each section teaches a concept, then you build it by chatting with Kiro. Let's get started!

---

## 🎯 How This Workshop Works

**Vibe Coding = Zero Manual Coding**

In this workshop, you won't write a single line of code manually. Instead:

1. **Copy a prompt** from this guide (they look like: "Create a script called...")
2. **Paste it into Kiro** (your AI coding assistant)
3. **Kiro generates the code** - complete, tested, production-ready
4. **Run the script** - see your agent come to life!

That's it! No syntax errors, no debugging, no googling documentation. Just natural language → working code.

**What You'll Build**

By the end, you'll have:
- A Strands agent with custom tools
- Memory to remember customers
- External API integration via gateway
- Production deployment on AWS
- Monitoring and observability

All built through conversation with Kiro!

---

## Part 1: Build Your First Agent

**What you'll learn**: Create a Strands agent with custom tools for handling returns and refunds.

**How you'll build it**: Simply copy the prompts below and paste them into Kiro. No coding required - Kiro generates everything!

---

### 📚 Learning Prompt 1: Understanding Strands Agents

**Ask Kiro** (just copy and paste this):

```
What is Strands and how do I build agents with it?
```

This helps you understand the framework before diving into code. Kiro will explain it in plain English!

---

### Prompt 1: Create Your Returns & Refunds Agent

**What to ask Kiro** (just copy and paste this):

```
Create a returns and refunds agent with these features:
- Agent name: returns_refunds_agent
- System prompt: You are a helpful returns and refunds assistant. Help customers check return eligibility, calculate refunds, and understand policies. Use the retrieve tool to access Amazon return policy documents for accurate information. Be friendly and accurate.
- Region: us-west-2
- Include the current_time tool
- Include the retrieve tool with Knowledge Base integration:
  - First, retrieve the knowledge base ID from CloudFormation stack 'knowledgebase' (OutputKey: 'KnowledgeBaseId')
  - If CloudFormation retrieval fails, use placeholder '<PLACE-YOUR-KB-ID>'
  - Save knowledge base ID to kb_config.json
  - Configure retrieve tool with the knowledge base ID
- Add 3 custom tools:
  - check_return_eligibility: checks if items can be returned based on purchase date and category
  - calculate_refund_amount: calculates refund based on price, condition, and return reason
  - format_policy_response: formats policy info in a customer-friendly way
- Save to: 01_returns_refunds_agent.py

⚠️ VALIDATION:
1. Identify task type and determine which MCP tool to use (or boto3 if Type 2)
2. Call MCP tool FIRST - extract and save the generated code
3. Validate APIs: Check method signatures using help() before using any boto3/library APIs
4. If MCP fails, STOP and ask user for permission - do NOT create code manually
```

**What happens**: Kiro generates a complete Strands agent with all the tools ready to use.

**Expected outcome**: 
- File created: `01_returns_refunds_agent.py`
- File created: `kb_config.json` with knowledge base ID
- Contains: Complete Strands agent code with @tool decorators for all 5 tools (current_time, retrieve, check_return_eligibility, calculate_refund_amount, format_policy_response)
- Knowledge Base: Configured with ID from CloudFormation stack 'knowledgebase'
- Region: All AWS operations use us-west-2
- Ready to run: Can be imported and tested immediately

**Why this matters**: This is your foundation agent with access to Amazon return policy documents. The retrieve tool lets your agent search the knowledge base for accurate policy information. You'll enhance it with memory and external tools in the next steps.

---

### Prompt 2: Test Your Agent

**What to ask Kiro** (just copy and paste this):

```
Create a test script called 02_test_agent.py that tests my returns agent with these questions:
- Import run_agent from 01_returns_refunds_agent.py using importlib
- What time is it?
- Can I return a laptop I purchased 25 days ago?
- Calculate my refund for a $500 item returned due to defect in like-new condition
- Explain the return policy for electronics in a simple way
- Use the retrieve tool to search the knowledge base for 'Amazon return policy for electronics'

⚠️ VALIDATION:
1. Identify task type and determine which MCP tool to use (or boto3 if Type 2)
2. Call MCP tool FIRST - extract and save the generated code
3. Validate APIs: Check method signatures using help() before using any boto3/library APIs
4. If MCP fails, STOP and ask user for permission - do NOT create code manually
```

**What happens**: Kiro creates a test script that validates all your agent's tools work correctly, including the retrieve tool accessing the knowledge base.

**Expected outcome**:
- File created: `02_test_agent.py`
- When run: Displays 5 test results showing each tool working
- Output: Agent responses for each test question
- Verification: All 5 tools execute successfully (current_time, check_return_eligibility, calculate_refund_amount, format_policy_response, retrieve)
- Knowledge Base: Retrieve tool successfully queries Amazon return policy documents

**Why this matters**: Always test before moving forward. This ensures your foundation is solid and the knowledge base integration works correctly.

---

## 🚀 Run Your Test

**What to ask Kiro** (just copy and paste this):

```
Execute the test file 02_test_agent.py

## Part 2: Add Memory to Remember Customers

**What you'll learn**: Give your agent memory so it remembers customer preferences and past interactions - just like a good customer service rep would!

**How you'll build it**: Keep vibe coding! Just tell Kiro what memory features you want, and it generates the scripts.

---

### 📚 Learning Prompt 2: Understanding AgentCore Memory

**Ask Kiro**:

```
What is AgentCore Memory and how does it help my agent remember things?
```

Learn about the three memory types: summaries (conversation context), preferences (what customers like), and semantic facts (important details).

---

```
What is AgentCore Runtime and how does it deploy my agent to production?
```

Learn about serverless deployment (no servers to manage!), auto-scaling (handles traffic spikes automatically), and built-in monitoring.

---

### Prompt 16: Create Runtime Permissions

**What to ask Kiro**:

```
Create a script called 16_create_runtime_role.py that creates an IAM role for runtime with permissions for:
- Region: us-west-2
- Bedrock model access: Resource "*", Actions: InvokeModel, InvokeModelWithResponseStream
- Memory: bedrock-agentcore:GetMemory, CreateEvent, GetLastKTurns, RetrieveMemory, ListEvents
- Knowledge Base: bedrock-agent:Retrieve (for accessing the knowledge base via retrieve tool)
- CloudWatch: logs:CreateLogGroup, CreateLogStream, PutLogEvents, DescribeLogStreams
- X-Ray: xray:PutTraceSegments, PutTelemetryRecords
- Gateway: bedrock-agentcore:InvokeGateway, GetGateway, ListGatewayTargets
- ECR: ecr:GetAuthorizationToken, BatchCheckLayerAvailability, GetDownloadUrlForLayer, BatchGetImage
- Trust Policy: bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com
- Save role ARN to runtime_execution_role_config.json

⚠️ VALIDATION:
1. Identify task type and determine which MCP tool to use (or boto3 if Type 2)
2. Call MCP tool FIRST - extract and save the generated code
3. Validate APIs: Check method signatures using help() before using any boto3/library APIs
4. If MCP fails, STOP and ask user for permission - do NOT create code manually
```

**What happens**: Kiro creates a script that sets up runtime permissions.

**Expected outcome**:
- File created: `16_create_runtime_role.py`
